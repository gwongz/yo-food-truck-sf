[Yo](https://www.justyo.co/) your location and get a link to a food truck that's located nearby - IN PROGRESS

Overview
--------

This is a Yo service that finds SF food trucks near you. Try it out by sending a Yo to YOFOODTRUCKSF. 

I used the [DataSF](https://data.sfgov.org/) API to get the food truck data. The Yelp and Google Places APIs are also used to filter the results.
