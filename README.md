Food Truck SF
=============

[Yo](www.justyo.co/) your location and you'll receive a food truck that's located nearby - IN PROGRESS

Overview
--------

This is a Yo service that returns a link to a food truck near your location. Try it out by sending a Yo to FOODTRUCKSF.

I used the [DataSF](https://data.sfgov.org/) API to get the food truck data. The Yelp and Google Places APIs are also used to filter the results.
